     * Day 13: The Sedronacci Sequence!!
     * 
     * It's becoming quite clear that Sedrick thinks a lot of himself. I wouldn't
     * say he's a Narcissist, until now! He has created a version of the Fibonacci
     * Sequence and named it after himself! We know he likes palindromes and
     * apparently he has decided to start off the Sedronacci Sequence with those
     * instead (don't worry they don't last too long). We have intel that he is
     * going to be using one of the large numbers as a seed in some future
     * encryption scheme! Diabolical! Our job, recruits, is to crack the Sedronacci
     * Sequenceâ„¢ and find the 414th number (414 is also a palindrome - don not
     * worry, the 414th number is not, but wouldn't it be nice if it was!). This is
     * what we know so far. Here are the first 7 numbers in the series:
     * 
     * 1. 11 
     * 2. 11 
     * 3. 22 
     * 4. 33 
     * 5. 55 
     * 6. 88 
     * 7. 143 
     * What is the 414th number in the series? It is big!
